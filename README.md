# Linguistic maps

This repository contains a random collection of linguistic maps .

## Directory structure

The file-naming convention is the following: `GLOSSONYM-AAYY.EXT`, where `GLOSSONYM` is the glossonym or glossonyms of the depicted glossolects, `AAYY` is the data source identification string. The string is built from the first two letters of the first author (`AA`) and the last two digits of the publication year (`YY`): for example, Gjinari 1988 = `gj88`. When there are multiple sources, they are concatenated by author's characters followed by the year digits: for example, Gjinari 1988 and Eslie and Woods 2009 = `gjes8809`.

Each map is available as a Sketch file, png and svg. Furthermore, each map is accompanied by an `.md` file with information on the map, like the source.
